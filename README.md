## User Story

```
As a novice coding bootcamp student
I want to have access to a mentor community
So that I can ask questions in a judgment-free space
```

## Description

'Cody Query' is an application that allows bootcamp students to ask questions and answer questions from their peers in a friendly environment. Every user can see the recently asked questions and answers. In the navbar, the user can select to see only questions tagged with a certain topic(eg. 'HTML'). If the user signs up, there are additional features, such as the ability to ask and answer questions using our rich text-editor.Also, every user has a profile page, where all the user's asked questions are displayed and can also be deleted. Using socket.io, the asked questions or responses appear in a real-time environment to all clients connected to the server. 
This application was created using MySQL, Sequelize, Node, Express, Handlebars, Socket.io, Passport, Jdenticon, Simplemde, Markdown-it, Jest and moment.js.
